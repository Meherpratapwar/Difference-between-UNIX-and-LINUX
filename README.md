# Difference-between-UNIX-and-LINUX

*What is Linux?
=>1.Linux is a free and open source operating system devloped from UNIX in 1991.
  2.It can be used from wristwatches to supercomputers. It is everywhere in our phones, laptops, PCs, cars and even in refrigerators. It is very much famous among developers and normal computer users.

*Free & Open Source Operating System
=>Most OS come in a compiled format means the main source code has run through a program called a compiler that translates the source code into a language that is known to the computer.
Modifying this compiled code is a tough job.
On the other hand, open-source is completely different. The source code is included with the compiled version and allows modification by anyone having some knowledge. It gives us the freedom to run the program, freedom to change the code according to our use, freedom to redistribute its copies, and freedom to distribute copies, which are modified by us.
In short, Linux is an operating system that is "for the people, by the people."
And we can dive in Linux without paying any cost. We can install it on Multiple machines without paying any cost.

*Why Use Linux
=>Linux is completely different from other operating systems in many ways.

It is an open source OS which gives a great advantage to the programmers as they can design their own custom operating systems.
It gives you a lot of option of programs having some different features so you can choose according to your need.
A global development community look at different ways to enhance its security, hence it is highly secured and robust so you don't need an anti virus to scan it regularly. Companies like Google, Amazon and Facebook use linux in order to protect their servers as it is highly reliable and stable.
Above all you don't have to pay for software and server licensing to install Linux, its absolutely free and you can install it on as many computers as you want.
Its completely trouble free operating system and don't have an issue with viruses, malware and slowing down your computer.

Advantages of Linux:
=>1.Open Source
As it is open-source, its source code is easily available. Anyone having programming knowledge can customize the operating system. One can contribute, modify, distribute, and enhance the code for any purpose.

2. Security
The Linux security feature is the main reason that it is the most favorable option for developers. It is not completely safe, but it is less vulnerable than others. Each application needs to authorize by the admin user. The virus is not executed until the administrator provides the access password. Linux systems do not require any antivirus program.

3. Free
Certainly, the biggest advantage of the Linux system is that it is free to use. We can easily download it, and there is no need to buy the license for it. It is distributed under GNU GPL (General Public License). Comparatively, we have to pay a huge amount for the license of the other operating systems.

4. Lightweight
Linux is lightweight. The requirements for running Linux are much less than other operating systems. In Linux, the memory footprint and disk space are also lower. Generally, most of the Linux distributions required as little as 128MB of RAM around the same amount for disk space.

5. Stability
Linux is more stable than other operating systems. Linux does not require to reboot the system to maintain performance levels. It rarely hangs up or slow down. It has big up-times.

6. Performance
Linux system provides high performance over different networks. It is capable of handling a large number of users simultaneously.

7. Flexibility
Linux operating system is very flexible. It can be used for desktop applications, embedded systems, and server applications too. It also provides various restriction options for specific computers. We can install only necessary components for a system.

8. Software Updates
In Linux, the software updates are in user control. We can select the required updates. There a large number of system updates are available. These updates are much faster than other operating systems. So, the system updates can be installed easily without facing any issue.

9. Distributions/ Distros
There are many Linux distributions available in the market. It provides various options and flavors of Linux to the users. We can choose any distros according to our needs. Some popular distros are Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, Linux Mint, Arch Linux, and many more.

For the beginners, Ubuntu and Linux Mint would be useful and, Debian and Fedora would be good choices for proficient programmers.

10. Live CD/USB
Almost all Linux distributions have a Live CD/USB option. It allows us to try or run the Linux operating system without installing it.

11. Graphical User Interface
Linux is a command-line based OS but, it provides an interactive user interface like Windows.

12. Suitable for programmers
It supports almost all of the most used programming languages such as C/C++, Java, Python, Ruby, and more. Further, it offers a vast range of useful applications for development.

The programmers prefer the Linux terminal over the Windows command line. The package manager on Linux system helps programmers to understand how things are done. Bash scripting is also a functional feature for the programmers. It also provides support for SSH, which helps in managing the servers quickly.

13. Community Support
Linux provides large community support. We can find support from various sources. There are many forums available on the web to assist users. Further, developers from the various opensource communities are ready to help us.

14. Privacy
Linux always takes care of user privacy as it never takes much private data from the user. Comparatively, other operating systems ask for the user's private data.

15. Networking
Linux facilitates with powerful support for networking. The client-server systems can be easily set to a Linux system. It provides various command-line tools such as ssh, ip, mail, telnet, and more for connectivity with the other systems and servers. Tasks such as network backup are much faster than others.

16. Compatibility
Linux is compatible with a large number of file formats as it supports almost all file formats.

17. Installation
Linux installation process takes less time than other operating systems such as Windows. Further, its installation process is much easy as it requires less user input. It does not require much more system configuration even it can be easily installed on old machines having less configuration.

18. Multiple Desktop Support
Linux system provides multiple desktop environment support for its enhanced use. The desktop environment option can be selected during installation. We can select any desktop environment such as GNOME (GNU Network Object Model Environment) or KDE (K Desktop Environment) as both have their specific environment.

19. Multitasking
It is a multitasking operating system as it can run multiple tasks simultaneously without affecting the system speed.

20. Heavily Documented for beginners
There are many command-line options that provide documentation on commands, libraries, standards such as manual pages and info pages. Also, there are plenty of documents available on the internet in different formats, such as Linux tutorials, Linux documentation project, Serverfault, and more. To help the beginners, several communities are available such as Ask Ubuntu, Reddit, and StackOverflow.


*Linux Features
1.Multiuser capability: Multiple users can access the same system resources like memory, hard disk, etc. But they have to use different terminals to operate.
2.Multitasking: More than one function can be performed simultaneously by dividing the CPU time intelligently.
3.Portability: Portability doesn't mean it is smaller in file size or can be carried in pen drives or memory cards. It means that it support different types of hardware.
4.Security: It provides security in three ways namely authenticating (by assigning password and login ID), authorization (by assigning permission to read, write and execute) and encryption (converts file into an unreadable format).
5.Live CD/USB: Almost all Linux distros provide live CD/USB so that users can run/try it without installing it.
6.Graphical User Interface (X Window system): Linux is command line based OS but it can be converted to GUI based by installing packages.
7.Support's customized keyboard: As it is used worldwide, hence supports different languages keyboards.
8.Application support: It has its own software repository from where users can download and install many applications.
9.File System: Provides hierarchical file system in which files and directories are arranged.
10.Open Source: Linux code is freely available to all and is a community based development project.
